Tie::DxHash
===========



Description
-----------
Tie::DxHash implements a hash which preserves insertion order and allows
duplicate keys.  It was written to facilitate the use of more complex
mod_rewrite rules in Apache configuration files written with Perl Sections.
See the module's POD for details.



Prerequisites
-------------
None, apart from a fairly recent version of Perl.  I would have thought that
v5.003 or later should be sufficient.



Installation
------------
The usual:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
